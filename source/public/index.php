  <h1>Digital Rocketry</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software and web development professional specializing in algorithms and architecture. I build the stuff behind the scenes.
    Digital Rocketry is a collection of my work.
    It's a sandbox that I use to play with new ideas and build things, but also a place to show off what I've made.

  	  <strong>Note to Chrome users:</strong>
  	  A recent <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation">Chrome update</a> removed support for NPAPI, killing many browser plugins,
  	  including Java and Unity Engine. As a result, several projects listed on this site will no longer work in Chrome.
  	  To make them work, you can either use another browser, or type <em>chrome://flags/#enable-npapi</em> into your Chrome browser, and enable the setting to allow NPAPI.
