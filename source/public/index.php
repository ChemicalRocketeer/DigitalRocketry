  <h1>Digital Rocketry</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer. Digital Rocketry is a collection of my work.
    It's a sandbox that I use to play with new ideas and build things, but also a place to show off what I've made.

  <h1>CampusCribz</h1>
  <p>
    Since January 2016, I've been working as a full stack developer at <a href="https://campuscribz.com">CampusCribz</a>.
    I've been working on their most critical features, including a new sublet feature for students, chat system, UI/UX across the board, and engineering a highly customized search algorithm targeted towards students.
    I've learned a lot with CampusCribz, picking up node.js with Express and MongoDB to build solutions to interesting problems.
    I've worked with data from partner companies, found and fixed broken existing code and code patterns, worked with the rest of the CampusCribz team to get lots of great work done, and engineered several new features from scratch.

  	  <strong>Note to Chrome users:</strong>
  	  <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation">Chrome has removed support for NPAPI</a>, killing many browser plugins,
  	  including Java and Unity Engine. As a result, some projects listed here will not work in Chrome.
  	  To make them work, I suggest you use another browser.
