  <h1>Digital Rocketry</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer. Digital Rocketry is a collection of my work.
    It's a sandbox that I use to play with new ideas and build things, but also a place to show off what I've made.

  <h1>CampusCribz</h1>
  <p>
    Since January 2016, I've been doing full stack development full time with CampusCribz, the off-campus college housing network.
    I've been working on their most critical features, including a new sublet feature for students, the chat system, UI/UX across the board, and engineering a highly customized database search algorithm targeted towards students.
    I've learned a lot with CampusCribz, picking up node.js with Express and MongoDB to work on interesting projects.
    I've worked with data from partner companies, found and fixed broken existing code and code patterns, worked with the CampusCribz team to get lots of great work done, and engineered several new features from scratch.

    <p>
  	  <strong>Note to Chrome users:</strong>
  	  A recent <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation">Chrome update</a> removed support for NPAPI, killing many browser plugins,
  	  including Java and Unity Engine. As a result, several projects listed on this site will no longer work in Chrome.
  	  To make them work, you can either use another browser, or type <em>chrome://flags/#enable-npapi</em> into your Chrome browser, and enable the setting to allow NPAPI.
